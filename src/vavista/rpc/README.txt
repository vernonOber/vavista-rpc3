The brokerRPC.py code belongs to Caregraph.org's FMQL product. Forked
from https://github.com/kevingill1966/vavista-rpc 1/2020 .

The brokerRPC3.py code is a modification to run under
Python 3. I do not understand all of the technical details
of the VistA RPC Broker yet to vouch for the documentation
listed here, or the completeness. -Vernon Oberholzer 2/2020
